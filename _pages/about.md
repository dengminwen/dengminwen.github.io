I am currently a Technical Director at Tencent, Shenzhen, China. 

I graduated with a bachelor's degree from Sun Yat-sen University in 2006 and a master's degree from the Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2009.

I has accumulated rich practical experience in two key areas: AI Infrastructure optimization and reinforcement learning for multi-agent decision-making.

My core achievement is leading the development of [Tencent Kai Wu Platform](https://aiarena.tencent.com/)., China's first self-developed open platform for multi-agent reinforcement learning. This platform has significantly improved the R&D efficiency of decision making AI. Meanwhile, I has promoted Reinforcement Learning Systems ecosystem, organizing the Tencent AI Arena Global Open Challenge for many consecutive years. The challenge has attracted hundreds of universities worldwide and cultivated tens of thousands of students. I has also released China's first industry standard "Reinforcement Learning Systems".

My research interests include LLM agents, deep reinforcement learning, high performance computing and their commercial applications.
